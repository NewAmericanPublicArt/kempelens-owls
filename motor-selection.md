### Estimating motor requirements ###

Using a fish scale I had lying around my garage, we had people pretend they were spinning the owl wheel. Based on tests with a few different people, we set the target of a typical force required being around 10 lbs when both owls are stopped. Applied at a radius of 3 ft, this is a torque of 30 ft-lbs, which is roughly 40 Nm.

For rotational speed, we decided the owl head should spin at around 5 or 6 seconds per rotation. This is equivalent to 10 RPM or and angular velocity of around 1 rad/s.

As the owls speed up, it will get harder to push on them as hard, but we might see peaks of, say 3x our target force. If the owl were really cranking, that might be 3 or 4 rad/s. That means a peak power of something like 120 Nm x 4 rad/s = 480 W. But that is someone pushing very hard while the owl is already whipping around like crazy. We'll target a peak of 500 W, with a typical power in the 10-50 W range.

### Different motor types ###

We know we want a permanent magnet motor, because we don't have any source of AC current, which is required to make a motor in which the rotor and stator are both electromagnets work.

Initially, we thought we wanted a brushless motor, because I was worried that brushes would require maintenance. 

Symax is a line of AC permanent magnet motors from Marathon Motors that looked good: http://www.symaxmotors.com/

I tried testing a pair of brushless permanent magnet motors intended for RC airplanes: https://hobbyking.com/en_us/electric-motors-1/fpv-drone-racing.html

It didn't work at all, so I called local motor enthusiast Nate Ball. He pointed out that for a brushless motor to run, you need sensors to detect the position of the rotor. If you just inject the AC waveforms generated by one motor into another, there is no way to keep the waves in phase with the rotor. At best, the rotor twitches erratically.

But Nate also pointed out that at low speeds, brush wear would be minimal, so a brushed DC motor would work fine.

### Brushed DC motor ###

This led pretty quickly to permanent magnet motors on Amazon.

For the prototype, I ordered two E30-150 DC brushed motor from http://ampflow.com, sold through Amazon Prime, $79: https://www.amazon.com/AmpFlow-E30-150-Brushed-Electric-Motor/dp/B009YJOD56/

This is from the Ampflow 3" series of motors: http://ampflow.com/three_inch_high_performance_motors.htm

The E-series has ferrite magnets, but for the final owls, we can upgraded to the A-series (either A28-150 or the higher power A28-400) to get neodymium magnets (and noise suppression caps, but we don't really care about those).
