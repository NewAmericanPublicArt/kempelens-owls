### Estimating motor requirements ###

Using a fish scale I had lying around my garage, we had people pretend they were spinning the owl wheel. Based on tests with a few different people, we set the target of a typical force required being around 10 lbs when both owls are stopped. Applied at a radius of 3 ft, this is a torque of 30 ft-lbs, which is roughly 40 Nm.

For rotational speed, we decided the owl head should spin at around 5 or 6 seconds per rotation. This is equivalent to 10 RPM or and angular velocity of around 1 rad/s.
